# Justification for Irrelevant Model prediction

## Overview
Despite utilizing advanced techniques such as RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV on the complete dataset, along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and feature selection via L1 regularization, the resulting evaluation scores do not meet the required threshold for model performance. This document aims to provide a detailed justification for these findings.

## Key Techniques Utilized

1. **RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV**:
   - Both techniques were employed to optimize hyperparameters systematically.
   - RandomizedSearchCV allows for a broader search of the hyperparameter space, while GridSearchCV exhaustively tests predefined parameter combinations.
   - Despite extensive tuning, neither method yielded satisfactory results.

2. **PCA for Feature Reduction**:
   - PCA was applied to reduce dimensionality and eliminate multicollinearity among features.
   - While PCA can enhance model performance by simplifying the feature space, it can also lead to loss of interpretability and potentially important variance.

3. **Feature Selection via L1 Regularization**:
   - L1 regularization was implemented to select relevant features and mitigate overfitting.
   - This method can enhance model generalization but may exclude features that contain valuable information necessary for predicting target variables.

## Observations

### 1. Model Complexity and undefitting
- The models trained may be not relative to the simplicity of the underlying data structure. 
- Linear models, while interpretable, may not capture complex relationships inherent in the data.

### 2. Data Quality and Feature Engineering
- The quality and richness of the dataset play crucial roles in model performance. Issues such as:
  - Missing values
  - Outliers
  - Noise in the data
- If the dataset does not adequately represent the underlying patterns, even well-tuned models may fail to achieve realistic evaluation metrics.

### 4. Potential Overfitting with Feature Selection
- L1 regularization can lead to overfitting, especially when the dataset is small relative to the number of features.
- The features selected might not generalize well to unseen data, contributing to poor performance.

## Conclusion

Despite leveraging sophisticated techniques such as RandomizedSearchCV, GridSearchCV, PCA, and L1 regularization, the models developed have not met the desired RÂ² score benchmarks. This may be attributed to a combination of model complexity issues, data quality, **Co-relation between Features and target** and potential *overfitting/underfitting*.
